\section{Applications and Results}\label{Chapter5}

So far we have discussed a number of different approximation techniques that can be to speed up some of the bottle necks within our Gaussian Process regression and classification algorithms. In this chapter, we shall see how they can be used within the naive implementations from \Cref{Chapter1} to provide faster processing, at the expense of a small amount of accuracy. We shall also go through an extensive treatment of how the various methods reviewed in previous chapters were implemented and how experiments were set up so that comparisons between them can be made and we can determine the most successful model.
