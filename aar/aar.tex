\section{Applications and Results}\label{Chapter5}

So far we have discussed a number of different approximation techniques to use to speed up some of the bottle necks within our Gaussian Process regression and classification algorithms. Here, we shall see how they can be used within the naive implementations from \Cref{Chapter1} to provide implementations that produce much faster predictions, at the expense of slightly less accurate results. We shall also go through an extensive treatment of how the various methods reviewed in previous chapters were implemented and the setup of the experiments used to make comparisons to determine the most successful method.
